ü§ñ Introduction
=================
By developing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:

Computer Vision and Deep Learning:
    Preprocessing images and utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically the VGG-16 model.
    Understanding transfer learning for adapting pre-trained models.

Web Development:
    Creating a user-friendly interface for image upload and result visualization.
    Implementing backend logic to process images and communicate with the CNN model.

Integration and Deployment:
    Integrating the VGG-16 model into the web application.
    Deploying the application on a server or cloud platform for accessibility.

Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning:
    Evaluating model accuracy and efficiency using relevant metrics.
    Exploring fine-tuning techniques for performance improvement.

User Experience (UX) Design:
    Designing an intuitive interface for seamless user interaction.
    Implementing user feedback features for a positive experience.

Project Management:
    Breaking down tasks, creating timelines, and planning the development process.
    Using version control systems like Git for effective collaboration and codebase management.
